# Project Description
In this project, I built a deep learning model to classify various hair types using image data. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for prediction, with ImageDataGenerator handling image loading and data augmentation. The model was developed and tested using TensorFlow and Keras, with tuning done through augmentation.
