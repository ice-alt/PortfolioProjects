# Project Description
In this project, I trained a logistic regression model using scikit-learn to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various personal and campaign-related features. Key concepts I used were One-hot encoding for handling variables, Train-validation-test split for proper model evaluation and the Feature Elimination Technique for measuring the importance of variables.
