# Project Description: DataWave Music – User Engagement Analysis
I cleaned and analyzed user engagement data from DataWave Music to uncover patterns in user behavior, satisfaction, and churn. 
After resolving issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting, I visualized key insights and identified factors affecting customer retention. 
I also recorded a presentation summarizing the findings and providing data-driven recommendations for DataWave’s leadership team.
