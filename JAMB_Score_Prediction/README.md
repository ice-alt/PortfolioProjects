# Project Description
In this project, I developed a regression model to predict students' scores on the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) standardized test. I evaluated machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost. Model performance was assessed using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
